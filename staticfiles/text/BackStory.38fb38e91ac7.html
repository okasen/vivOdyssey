<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">There were wizards. The wizards had pets. One day, one wizard took her housecat and gene spliced(???) it with a chicken. It was fucking cool.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">but then another wizard saw and was like &quot;WTF I want one&quot; so he went to his lab. With his lab. His golden lab. Labrador Retriever. He took his lab and in his lab he turned his lab into a seal. He turned the dog into a seal, but only halfway mind, and the other lab (the room) was left unsealed.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">Not to be outdone, wizard #1 mixed a squirrel with a lizard. This made wizard #2 angy, and he retaliated by breeding a lion to the biggest fucking eagle he could find.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">this back and forth continued for months. Eventually, the first wizard made another chicken cat, to be friends with the first one. Well huehueuehe they were more than friends! And soon, the first chicken cat laid an egg. It was white with sparse brown specks.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">The wizardess had no doubt that this was a fertilized egg that could hatch into a baby chicken cat, so she decided to put it in an incubator to help it hatch. Unfortunately, the other cat chicken got hungry one night, and ended up eating the egg right in front of the wizardess! Well, there must have been some magic radioactivity bullshit going on in that egg, because once the chicken cat ate the egg, he started to glow with a faint white light. But after that, nothing seemed to happen... until the cat chicken caught a rat later that night. The wizardness noticed a difference; the chicken cat was clearly much stronger now that it had eaten the egg.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">so the wizardess set up an experiment. She left the two chicken cats together for some &quot;quality time&quot; and made sure to harvest the eggs to a safe location. Once she had three, she proceeded to feed all three eggs to the chicken cat that had eaten the egg before. He became larger, stronger, and much faster after each egg was eaten-- that much was clear. </span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">What wasn't clear was that the female chicken cat had laid one more egg, and the wizardess didn't notice. The chicken cat (female one!) laid on the egg to keep it warm, and eventually it hatched into a baby chicken cat.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">The baby chickat was weak, sure, but it was also a new creature. Now the wizardess had a dilemma. Should she raise an army of these chicken cats (with the purpose of destroying the laboratory of her wizaring rivals) or create a smaller militia of very strong (but fewer) chicken cats? Quality, or quantity?</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">Well, chickens and cats both like company, so the wizardess decided that the best course of action was to primarily hatch the eggs and form a small army of chickats.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">Little did she know, her arch rival had found the same dilemma with his new invented species: Gryphons. Except he chose the alternate strategy; he fed the eggs from his breeding pair to the strongest Gryphon and created a complete fucken monster. </span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">Eventually, the day came when the two wizards would fight. Wizardess sent her chickats in a massive siege to attack the other wizard. The wizard sent out his Gryphon. It was a stalemate... until an unforseen third wizard joined the fray.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">this third wizard had been watching both wizards from the shadows and taken note of their single note strategies. This wizard, however, had her own strategy. She took the strongest of different species and bred them to create offspring with the best qualities of each parent. She used the strongest eggs for hatching, and fed the weakest eggs to her army of varied animals.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">But she wasn't interested in dominion. She just wanted peace, actually, because the two wizards bickering was fucking obnoxious. So she used her smaller army of stronger creatures to quell the fighting, and then summoned the wizards to discuss peace.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">It didn't work-- the army of chickats and the gryphon were turned on the third wizard by the other two wizards, and they killed her. But her army of creatures, stricken with grief, sought revenge on the other two wizards (and y'know, killed them too).</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:14pt;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:14pt;">Now leaderless, the factions of creatures had to find ways to survive together. Eventually, they sorted themselves not by the ideals of their wizard creators, but by the way their part of the world; the creatures of the sea, the creatures of the sky, and the creatures of the land. Sequestered into their own dominions, there was a relatively stable peace across the land.</span></p></body></html><p><h2>The now</h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd">
